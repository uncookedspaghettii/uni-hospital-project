# Hospital Management System â€“ Java Project

This is a Java-based Hospital Management System developed as part of a university project by two students.

## Project Overview

The system simulates basic hospital operations using object-oriented programming concepts in Java. It manages patient records, emergency priorities, treatment histories, and doctor assignments.

## Features

- Patient Records: Allows adding, updating, and displaying patients' personal information.
- Emergency Queue: Uses a priority queue to manage patients based on the urgency of their condition.
- Treatment History: Maintains a stack-based log of each patient's treatments.
- Doctor Assignments: Manages doctor profiles, including departments and schedules.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Data Structures (Linked Lists, Stacks, Priority Queues, Hash Maps)

## How to Run

1. Make sure Java is installed on your system.
2. Place all .java files in the same directory.
3. Compile the files:
   
bash
   javac *.java
